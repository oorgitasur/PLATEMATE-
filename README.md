# PlateMate 🍝



# Introduction🐨
This project is developed for the Intel GenAI Hackathon at Cognizance’24 and aims to provide a comprehensive solution for individuals managing diabetes. The application reads data from a glucometer to detect diabetes, analyzes uploaded food items to determine their nutritional value, and provides personalized diet recommendations based on the user's health condition.


# Features✨
_**Glucometer Reading Analysis:**_ Detects diabetes based on glucometer readings and provides insights into blood sugar levels.

_**Food Item Identification:**_ Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify uploaded food items from images or text inputs.

_**Nutritional Value Calculation:**_ Determines the nutritional value of identified food items, including calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

_**Personalized Recommendations:**_ Suggests whether the user should or can consume a particular food item based on their health condition and nutritional requirements.


## Technologies Used

_**Python:**_ TensorFlow, OpenCV
_**Machine Learning:**_ Keras, Scikit-Learn
_**Database:**_ SQLite
